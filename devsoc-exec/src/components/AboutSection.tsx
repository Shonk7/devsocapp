        Hola! I was originally an Electrical Engineering BE/ME student but
        after starting my bachelor's thesis I realised I'm not built for
        research haha. So I switched to a double degree in Computer Science and it's been pretty fun!
        DevSoc's been a big part of why!

       Last year, due to my experiences working as a Full-stack
       at Transport and my other society roles, I applied for the Sponsorship team.
       It was pretty fun working with the team, managing sponsors and
        helping with some of the bigger events â†’ Starlight ðŸ”¥
